Kifu Recorder
=============

Kifu Recorder is an app which aims to record go (weiqi, baduk) matches
in a simple and easy way. It uses a mobile device's camera to watch a go
game and creates a SGF game record as output. It works well in optimal
conditions (bright environment, good camera positioning), but it's still
a work in progress.

Requirements
============

In order to run this application, you must have OpenCV Manager installed
in your Android smartphone. You also must have the OpenCV4Android
library added to this project.

Your mobile device must have a moderately powerful processor and camera
for an optimal experience.
